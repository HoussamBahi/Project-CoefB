## The prediction of the second Virial coefficient (B) of fluid mixtures.


ANN model is proposed for the prediction of the B coefficient of organic and
inorganic mixtures, reflecting the PVT (pressure, volume, temperature) behaviour of fluids, using
the fluidsâ€™ critical properties, acentric factors and dipole moments as inputs. The fully connected
multilayer perceptron was built by minimizing the mean percentage error between predicted values
and more than 10000 experimental points of B available in the literature. The optimal ANN
structure found gave very accurate results as its 10-fold cross-validation
average root mean squared error is of 41 cm3/mol.
